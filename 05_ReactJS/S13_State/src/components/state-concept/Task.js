  setContent(`HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. It provides a system of elements and tags that define headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, forms, and other components of a webpage. By using HTML, developers can organize information in a logical and accessible manner, allowing browsers to correctly display content for users. HTML works alongside CSS, which controls design and layout, and JavaScript, which adds interactivity and dynamic behavior. Over time, HTML has evolved to support multimedia elements like audio and video, as well as semantic tags that improve accessibility and search engine optimization. Simple to learn yet powerful in application, HTML is essential for beginners entering web development and remains a core technology for professionals building modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites across different devices and platforms, used in education, business, and creative industries worldwide today without major limitations.
